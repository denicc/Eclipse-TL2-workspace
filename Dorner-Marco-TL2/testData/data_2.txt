Every project needs a great project manager, and my incredible editor Mary Treseler and her amazing production staff were a pleasure to work with on this book (as always). Writing a technical book is a long and stressful endeavor, to say the least, and it’s a remarkable experience to work with professionals who are able to help you make it through that exhausting journey and deliver a beautifully polished product that you can be proud to share with the world. Kristen Brown, Rachel Monaghan, and Rachel Head truly made all the difference in taking my best efforts to an entirely new level of professionalism.
The detailed feedback that I received from my very capable editorial staff and technical reviewers was also nothing short of amazing. Ranging from very technically oriented recommendations to software-engineering-oriented best practices with Python to per‐ spectives on how to best reach the target audience as a mock reader, the feedback was beyond anything I could have ever expected. The book you are about to read would not be anywhere near the quality that it is without the thoughtful peer review feedback that I received. Thanks especially to Abe Music, Nicholas Mayne, Robert P.J. Day, Ram Nar‐ asimhan, Jason Yee, and Kevin Makice for your very detailed reviews of the manuscript. It made a tremendous difference in the quality of this book, and my only regret is that we did not have the opportunity to work together more closely during this process. Thanks also to Tate Eskew for introducing me to Vagrant, a tool that has made all the difference in establishing an easy-to-use and easy-to-maintain virtual machine experi‐ ence for this book.
I also would like to thank my many wonderful colleagues at Digital Reasoning for the enlightening conversations that we’ve had over the years about data mining and topics in computer science, and other constructive dialogues that have helped shape my pro‐ fessional thinking. It’s a blessing to be part of a team that’s so talented and capable. Thanks especially to Tim Estes and Rob Metcalf, who have been supportive of my work on time-consuming projects (outside of my professional responsibilities to Digital Rea‐ soning) like writing books.
Finally, thanks to every single reader or adopter of this book’s source code who provided constructive feedback over the lifetime of the first edition. Although there are far too many of you to name, your feedback has shaped this second edition in immeasurable ways. I hope that this second edition meets your expectations and finds itself among your list of useful books that you’d recommend to a friend or colleague.
